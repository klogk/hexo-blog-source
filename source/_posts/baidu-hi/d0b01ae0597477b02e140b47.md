<p>现在应用正在逐步推广的一种web服务器,Async IO是最大的特点,CGI上的表现也相当不错....</p><p>以下是官方介绍</p><p>Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility -- all of these describe lighttpd (pron. lighty) which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a webserver; as it is designed and optimized for high performance environments. With a small memory footprint compared to other web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load, and advanced feature set (FastCGI, SCGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many more) lighttpd is the perfect solution for every server that is suffering load problems. And best of all it's Open Source licensed under the revised BSD license.</p><p>Web 2.0</p><p>lighttpd powers several popular Web 2.0 sites like YouTube, wikipedia and meebo. Its high speed io-infrastructure allows them to scale several times better with the same hardware than with alternative web-servers.</p><p>This fast web server and its development team create a web-server with the needs of the future web in mind:</p><ul><li>Faster FastCGI</li><li>COMET meets mod_mailbox</li><li>Async IO</li></ul><p>Its event-driven architecture is optimized for a large number of parallel connections (keep-alive) which is important for high performance AJAX applications.</p>
